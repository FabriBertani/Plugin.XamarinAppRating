## Usage
**Warning** - You should be careful about how and when you ask users to rate your app, there may be penalties from stores. As an advice, use a counter on the app start and storage that counter, when the counter reachs certain number it shows a dialog to the users asking them if they want to rate the app first, if they decline restart the counter to ask them later, also leave the option to do it themselves.

```csharp
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        var appAlreadyRated = Preferences.Get("application_rated");

        if (!appAlreadyRated)
          Task.Run(() => CheckAppCountAndRate());
    }

    private async Task CheckAppCountAndRate()
    {
        var applicationCount = Preferences.Get("application_counter");

        if (applicationCount >= 5)
        {
            if (!await DisplayAlert ("Rate this App!", "Are you enjoying the app so far? Would you like to leave a review in the store?", "Yes", "No");)
            {
                Preferences.Set("application_counter", 0);

                return;
            }

            // This method use Facebookâ„¢ store apps as example.
            await CrossAppRating.Current.PerformPlatformRateAppAsync("com.facebook.katana", "id284882215", "9wzdncrf0083")

            Preferences.Set("application_rated", true);
